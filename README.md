# SinfulBot
SinfulBot is a Discord bot that runs on the discordpy api. It allows you to preform a multitude of specialized tasks, and one that required a little bit of loophole exploration to get to work. This bot if used incorrectly can get your discord developer account suspended or banned. I am not responsible for anything that happens as a result of executing this code.

Dependancies:
- asyncio
- discordpy
- chalk

Commands:
- info (@DiscordUsername) - displays info about targeted user
- serverinfo - displays server information 
- rolestats - displays some server information but mostly how many users are in a permission role
- dmall (text) - send a direct message to all users in a server (This command can get your dev account banned from discord)
